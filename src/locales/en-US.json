Although networking standards recommend to always prefer multicast and broadcast when searching for networking services and devices, many modern IoT devices have still been using unicast sweeps to find peers: this means that lookup, onboarding, pairing or service usage when you have a big network will make the device lookup for the service on a very big number of possible devices, instead of just 256/512. A good example of this is also Windows workgroup: NetBIOS is unicast, so lookup of other PC and printers in a big network takes much longer.
